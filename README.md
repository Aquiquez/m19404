======

The site contains basic codes for different image processing and computer vision tasks that i have encountered in my work.

Refer to Listed Blogs : http://pi-virtualworld.blogspot.in/ ,http://eternalwandering777.wordpress.com or scribd repository http://www.scribd.com/pi19404 for detailed description of algorithms

Below are some of algorithms for which code is added in repository

Color-Constancy-Algorithms :Gray World,shade of gray,max rgb,gray edge,max edge,contrast stretching
Image enhancement using Fusion : Image enhancement using Fusion algorithm
Temporal Image filter : Laplacian of Gaussian Temporal Filter for motion segmentation
Controlled Adaptive Local Histogram Equalization for image enhancement
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor computation
Parallel Programming using OpenCL - Color Conversion BGR-HSB,BGR-GRAY,HSV-BGR,2D Convolution,Box Filter,Convolution Using Seperable Filters
